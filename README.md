# The Classical Genre Responsive Website Project

### What does it do and what need does it fulfil?

This project uses skills learnt to build a mobile-first responsive Website for a Musical Genre, with four very different Classical Artists.  The idea is to update a website which was designed by myself as part of another course by bringing it into a more modern and more technological accessable site.

It fulfils the need for current subscribers and potential subscribers to have the facility of listing to the music, watch a music video, subscribe to new letter, enquire through a contact form of upcoming events, as well as view pictures related to the Artists that is currently available.

### Functionality of project

The website is fully responsive, on desktop and larger screen sizes there is a small amount of additional content (one picture on the header).
The navigation is functional and has two forms available, subscribe to a news letter and make enquiries about upcoming concerts.  

### User Experience

Documentation pertaining to the site can be accessed within the "Documents" folder.
Strategy
Scope
Structure & Skeleton
Wireframes for previous site from a desktop and mobile view.
Wireframes for new site which is now viewable on mobile and desktop views.
Demonstrating the different look of the website.

At the top of each page the user has the options to visit the home page, view artists, make enquires or sign up to the newsletter.  From within each of the artists bio's page there is an additional Gallary page where the user can view past and present photo's of the respective artist.
Contained on each of the individual artist page the user can view a timeline of the artist career to date, view a sample of well know video's, download the lyrics and also listen to some audio that may no longer be accessible.

At the foot of each of the artist's page the user is invited to visit the artist current and live social media websites, for up-todate information.

### Future Development

If possible to add more artists to the website.  Further development to include a more responsive website that will enhance the overall user experience.  Getting the thankyou page to work, this currently not working.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- Bash
- Ubuntu
- GIT
- GITHUB
- Google Chrome developer tools
- Cloud 9 IDE
- Javascript and JQuery are imported for the join the fan club modal.  I also used code for implementing the "scroll to top of document" feature and also allowing the user to select a date from a calendar that is contained within the contact page.

### Deployment

Website was coded in Cloud 9 IDE, a local GIT directory was used for version control and then uploaded to GITHUB using Ubuntu / Bash script. Once in a GITHUB repositories it was made live using GITHUB Pages. The website can be found at:https: //ammcl.github.io/milestone-1/

### Testing

Each page was tested locally and on GITHUB pages using Chrome developer tools, testing its functionality as well as look and feel (in landscape and portrait mode) on Galaxy S5, Nexus 5S, Nexus 6P, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop. All links were tested. 

Assistance was also sought from friends and family in relation the overall user experience of the website.  I also requested reviews from my Code Institute peers where they gave me invaluable advice.

### Work based on other code

As previously stated assistance was sought for code using the following websites :-
