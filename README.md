# The Classical Genre Responsive Website Project

### What does it do and what need does it fulfil?

This project uses skills learnt to build a mobile-first responsive Website for a Musical Genre, with four very different Classical Artists.  The idea is to update a website which was designed by myself as part of another course by bringing it into a more modern and more technological accessable site.

It fulfils the need for current subscribers and potential subscribers to have the facility of listing to the music, watch a music video, subscribe to new letter, enquire through a contact form of upcoming events, as well as view pictures related to the Artists that is currently available.

### Functionality of project

The website is fully responsive, on desktop and larger screen sizes there is a small amount of additional content (one picture on the header).
The navigation is functional and has two forms available, subscribe to a news letter and make enquiries about upcoming concerts.
